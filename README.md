## For what is this repository?

This is a repository to store linux scripts, tutorials and samples about linux system administration.

In this day, (2016-07-25), I have no linux certification, (only experience with). 
I start this repo to write all I know about linux, all I will learn about and, in the future, my experience and tips about the certification tests.

Contributors are welcome.
